#GEA
##Introduction

GEA provides a music streaming service with built-in region- based music
trending. This allows users to stream the songs they are interested in and view
the trending songs in particular regions. By rating the songs they listen to,
users contribute to the trending data and increase the popularity of particular
songs in their region. By storing information related to songs played, song
ratings, and location of users, we will be able to display useful trending maps
and provide access to recent trends. Although there are many lists of the top
music hits available, they do not provide region-specific details. Our current
target audience is high school and college aged people as they are the most
likely to both stream music and use location services on mobile devices. Later
in development, the product could be adapted to show worldwide trends, and the
target would obviously shift to accommodate.

##Overview

This project consists of a web server, a browser-based client, and an Android-
based client. The server provides services for the clients such as search and
rating aggregation and so it should be running in order for the clients to
function. The server is also responsible for serving the browser-based client.
For instructions on how to set up the server, see
[`web/README.md`](web/README.md). For instructions on how to build the Android
client, see [`android/README.md`](android/README.md). There is also a pre-
compiled `apk` available for download to use on Android
[here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/OpenGea/GeaBETA.apk).
