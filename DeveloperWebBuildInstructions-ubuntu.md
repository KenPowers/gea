#Developer Web Build Instructions for Ubuntu
####Tested with a clean install of Ubuntu 12.10

1. To download the package, you can use git. To install git, open a terminal window and run:

		sudo apt-get install git

2. Set up your username, email, and password by following GitHub's set up guide: <https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git>

3. Now you need to clone your fork. Go to <https://github.com/OpenGea/gea> and click the Fork button.

4. Once OpenGea is forked, open a terminal and `cd` into the folder you would like to use for your project workspace. Then clone the repository with:

		git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/gea.git

5. Once the package has been cloned, run:

		cd gea/web

6. Set up the web system by running the installer script and enter your computer password when prompted:

		./ubuntu-installer.sh

7. If you do not have an Rdio API key, go to <http://developer.rdio.com/> and follow the section labeled "How to Get Started". Then create a text file named `rdio.json` with the following content:

		{
  			"key": "YOUR_RDIO_KEY",
  			"secret": "YOUR_RDIO_SECRET"
		}

8. Copy your rdio.json file containing your Rdio API key and secret in JSON format into the folder `gea/web/config/`.

9. Close all terminal windows to reload your bash environment OR run the following to initialize your bash environment:

		source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh

10. To start the server, run the following command in a terminal from the `gea/web` folder:

		node app

#####Opening the Web Client

To see the web client, open a browser (currently only the latest versions of Firefox (19.0+) and Google Chrome (26+) are supported) and navigate to <http://localhost:3000>.

**NOTE: In order to be able to use the web client, you must have the Adobe Flash plugin installed for your browser. The installer script will install the Flash plugin.**
